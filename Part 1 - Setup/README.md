# Part 1: Setup

> **‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes (or 5 minutes with GitHub Codespaces!)

## In this workshop

In this workshop, you will set up your development environment for building AI applications with .NET. You'll install the required tools and configure your environment to work with the workshop materials.

## üöÄ Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started with no local installation required!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dotnet-presentations/ai-workshop?quickstart=1)

**Why use Codespaces?**

- ‚úÖ No Docker installation required
- ‚úÖ Pre-configured environment with all tools
- ‚úÖ Works from any computer with a browser
- ‚úÖ Perfect for workshops and training sessions

Click the badge above, then skip to [Step 2: Create a GitHub Account](#step-2-create-a-github-account-if-needed) to continue. [Learn more about Codespaces](../.devcontainer/README.md).

## Local Development Setup

If you prefer to work locally or need offline access, follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Visual Studio 2022 with the Web & Cloud workload installed
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- .NET AI Web Chatbot template installed
- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- GitHub account (required for GitHub Models access)
- Azure subscription (optional, but recommended for full experience)
- GitHub Copilot subscription (optional, but recommended for full experience)

> [!TIP]
> **Alternative: Local AI with Ollama**: If you don't have a GitHub account or prefer to work offline, this workshop includes an Ollama-based development container option that runs AI models locally. See the [Development Container Options](./../.github/.devcontainer/README.md) for details.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the workshop repository to get all the necessary files:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/ai-workshop.git
cd ai-workshop
```

> [!NOTE]
> When deploying to Azure, you may need to create resources in a specific resource group (e.g., "rg-mygenaiapp"). If you are following this workshop in a managed environment, use the resource group provided by your instructor or organization. Otherwise, you can create your own resource group as needed.

## Step 1: Install Required Tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using a managed or pre-configured environment, some prerequisites may already be installed for you.

1. **Install Visual Studio 2022:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio 2022 from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
   - During installation, select the "Web & Cloud" in the workloads selection screen
   - Ensure the ".NET 9.0 SDK" is included in your installation

1. **Install .NET AI Web Chatbot template:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Run the following command:

     ```powershell
     dotnet new install Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Templates
     ```

1. **Verify installations:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Run the following commands to verify the installation:

     ```powershell
     dotnet new aichatweb --help
     ```

   - You should see the help information for the *AI Chat Web App (C#)* displayed.

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Account (if needed)

If you don't already have a GitHub account, follow these steps to create one:

1. **Create a GitHub account:**
   - Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
   - Enter your email address and create a password
   - Choose a username
   - Complete the account creation process by following the on-screen instructions
   - Verify your email address (GitHub will send you a verification email)
