> **Prerequisites**: Complete [Part 7: MCP Server Basics](../Part%207%20-%20MCP%20Server%20Basics/README.md) to understand MCP fundamentals before building business tools.

## Overview

Building on the MCP fundamentals from Part 7, you'll now create a sophisticated MCP server that connects AI agents to **business systems and data**. This part demonstrates how MCP can bridge AI assistants with real-world business scenarios like order management, inventory tracking, and customer service.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this part, you will:

- ✅ Understand how MCP enables AI access to business systems
- ✅ Implement realistic business tools with ContosoOrders data
- ✅ Handle complex data structures and business logic in MCP tools
- ✅ Test business scenarios with GitHub Copilot
- ✅ Apply security and validation principles for business data

## Business Context: ContosoOrders System

**ContosoOrders** is a simulated outdoor gear e-commerce system that manages:

- 📦 **Order Management**: Track orders, statuses, and delivery information
- 👥 **Customer Data**: Customer profiles, order history, and preferences  
- 📊 **Inventory System**: Product availability, pricing, and categorization
- 🚚 **Shipping Integration**: Tracking numbers and delivery status

### Why Business MCP Tools Matter

Traditional AI assistants can only work with their training data, but with MCP business tools, they can:

- **Access live business data** instead of outdated information
- **Perform real-time operations** like order lookups and inventory checks
- **Integrate with existing systems** without requiring API knowledge
- **Provide contextual business insights** based on current data

## Step 1: Explore the Enhanced MCP Server

Navigate to `Part 8 - Enhanced MCP Server` and examine the `ContosoOrdersMcpServer` project:

```text
ContosoOrdersMcpServer/
├── Program.cs                       # MCP server with business tools
├── Tools/
│   └── ContosoOrdersTools.cs       # Business data access tools
├── .mcp/
│   └── server.json                 # Business server metadata
└── ContosoOrdersMcpServer.csproj   # Project with business dependencies
```

## Step 2: Understanding Business MCP Tools

Open `ContosoOrdersMcpServer/Tools/ContosoOrdersTools.cs` and examine the three business tools:

### Tool 1: Order Details Lookup

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
[Description("Retrieves order information from the Contoso business system.")]
public async Task<string> GetOrderDetails(
    [Description("The order ID to look up")] string orderId)
```

**Business Value**: Customer service agents can instantly access complete order information including shipping addresses, tracking numbers, and order status.

### Tool 2: Customer Order Search  

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
[Description("Searches for orders by customer name.")]
public async Task<string> SearchOrdersByCustomer(
    [Description("Customer name to search for")] string customerName)
```

**Business Value**: Support teams can quickly find all orders for a customer to resolve issues or provide order history.

### Tool 3: Product Inventory Status

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
[Description("Gets inventory status for a specific product.")]
public async Task<string> GetProductInventory(
    [Description("Product name or SKU to check inventory for")] string productName)
```

**Business Value**: Sales teams can check real-time inventory before making commitments to customers.

## Step 3: Examine Business Data Structures

The ContosoOrders tools return rich, structured business data:

### Order Data Example

```json
{
  "Customer": "John Doe",
  "Total": "$150.00",
  "Status": "Shipped",
  "Items": ["Camping Tent", "Sleeping Bag"],
  "ShippingAddress": "123 Adventure Lane, Outdoor City, OC 12345",
  "OrderDate": "2025-07-25",
  "TrackingNumber": "1Z999AA1012345675"
}
```

### Customer Orders Example  

```json
{
  "Customer": "John Doe",
  "Orders": [
    {
      "OrderId": "12345",
      "Total": "$150.00", 
      "Status": "Shipped",
      "Date": "2025-07-25"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Inventory Data Example

```json
{
  "Product": "Camping Tent",
  "Details": {
    "SKU": "CT-001",
    "InStock": 15,
    "Price": "$89.99",
    "Category": "Shelter"
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Build and Configure the Business MCP Server

1. **Build the ContosoOrders server**:

   ```powershell
   cd "Part 8 - Enhanced MCP Server\ContosoOrdersMcpServer"
   dotnet build
   ```

2. **Update your MCP configuration** to include both servers.

   **For VS Code** - Update `.vscode/mcp.json` to run both weather and business servers:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "MyMcpServer": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "dotnet",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--project", 
           "Part 7 - MCP Server Basics/MyMcpServer"
         ]
       },
       "ContosoOrdersMcpServer": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "dotnet",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--project",
           "Part 8 - Enhanced MCP Server/ContosoOrdersMcpServer"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For Visual Studio 2022** - Update `.mcp.json` in your solution directory:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "MyMcpServer": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "dotnet",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--project",
           "../../Part 7 - MCP Server Basics/MyMcpServer"
         ]
       },
       "ContosoOrdersMcpServer": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "dotnet",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--project",
           "../../Part 8 - Enhanced MCP Server/ContosoOrdersMcpServer"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart your IDE** (VS Code or Visual Studio 2022) to load the new business server configuration.

## Step 5: Test Business Scenarios with GitHub Copilot

Now test realistic business scenarios that demonstrate the power of MCP business tools.

### Scenario 1: Customer Service Order Lookup

**Customer Call**: "Hi, I'm calling about my order 12345. Can you tell me the status?"

**Ask Copilot**:

```text
A customer is asking about order 12345. Can you look up the details and provide a summary of the order status?
```

**Expected Result**: Copilot will use `GetOrderDetails` and provide comprehensive order information including shipping status and tracking number.

### Scenario 2: Customer Order History

**Customer Request**: "I can't remember all my recent orders. Can you help me find them?"

**Ask Copilot**:

```text
Can you find all orders for customer "Jane Smith" and summarize her recent order activity?
```

**Expected Result**: Copilot will use `SearchOrdersByCustomer` to find and summarize all orders for that customer.

### Scenario 3: Inventory Management

**Sales Question**: "A customer wants to buy hiking boots. Do we have them in stock?"

**Ask Copilot**:

```text
Check our inventory for hiking boots. Do we have them available and what's the current price?
```

**Expected Result**: Copilot will use `GetProductInventory` to provide real-time stock levels and pricing.

### Scenario 4: Complex Business Analysis

**Manager Request**: "I need a summary of our camping gear inventory and any recent orders for those products."

**Ask Copilot**:

```text
Check inventory for camping tents and sleeping bags, then find any recent orders that included these items. Provide a business summary.
```

**Expected Result**: Copilot will use multiple tools to gather inventory data and order information, then provide a comprehensive business analysis.

## Step 6: Understanding Tool Composition

One of MCP's powerful features is **tool composition** - AI agents can use multiple tools together to solve complex problems.

### Example: Customer Issue Resolution

**Complex Scenario**: "Customer John Doe called saying his tent order is late, and he wants to know about our other tents in stock."

**Ask Copilot**:

```text
Help resolve a customer issue: John Doe says his tent order is delayed. Can you:
1. Find his recent orders 
2. Check current tent inventory
3. Suggest next steps for customer service
```

**What Happens**:

1. Copilot calls `SearchOrdersByCustomer` for "John Doe"
2. Copilot calls `GetProductInventory` for "Camping Tent"  
3. Copilot analyzes the data and provides actionable recommendations

## Step 7: Security and Validation Considerations

> **📚 Note**: This step provides **educational content** about security best practices. The code examples below demonstrate concepts you should consider when building production MCP servers. **You don't need to modify the ContosoOrdersMcpServer project** - these are examples to learn from for your own future projects.

When building business MCP tools, consider these important aspects:

### Data Validation

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetOrderDetails(string orderId)
{
    // Validate input parameters
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(orderId))
        return "Error: Order ID is required";
    
    // Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
    orderId = orderId.Trim();
    
    // Check authorization (in real scenarios)
    // if (!HasPermission(currentUser, orderId))
    //     return "Error: Access denied";
}
```

### Error Handling

```csharp
try 
{
    // Business logic here
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(result);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log errors securely (don't expose sensitive data)
    return $"Error: Unable to process request. Reference ID: {Guid.NewGuid()}";
}
```

### Best Practices for Business Tools

- ✅ **Validate all inputs** before processing
- ✅ **Implement proper error handling** with safe error messages
- ✅ **Log operations** for audit trails
- ✅ **Apply security constraints** based on user roles
- ✅ **Rate limit tool usage** to prevent abuse
- ✅ **Sanitize outputs** to prevent data leakage

## Step 8: Advanced Business Scenarios

> **📚 Note**: This step shows **example patterns** for advanced business scenarios. These code examples demonstrate how you could extend MCP servers beyond the basic ContosoOrdersMcpServer. **You don't need to implement these** - they're provided as inspiration for building your own advanced MCP tools.

### Multi-System Integration

Real business MCP servers often integrate with multiple systems:

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
[Description("Process a return request with inventory and accounting updates.")]
public async Task<string> ProcessReturn(string orderId, string reason)
{
    // 1. Look up order details
    var order = await GetOrderFromDatabase(orderId);
    
    // 2. Update inventory levels
    await UpdateInventoryForReturn(order.Items);
    
    // 3. Process refund
    await ProcessRefund(order.Total, order.PaymentMethod);
    
    // 4. Generate return label
    var label = await GenerateReturnLabel(order.ShippingAddress);
    
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { 
        ReturnId = Guid.NewGuid(),
        RefundAmount = order.Total,
        ReturnLabel = label.TrackingNumber 
    });
}
```

### Configuration-Driven Tools

Make tools flexible with configuration:

```csharp
public class ContosoOrdersTools 
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _config;
    
    public ContosoOrdersTools(IConfiguration config)
    {
        _config = config;
    }
    
    [McpServerTool]
    public async Task<string> GetOrderDetails(string orderId)
    {
        var connectionString = _config["ContosoDb:ConnectionString"];
        var maxResults = _config.GetValue<int>("Orders:MaxResults", 100);
        
        // Use configuration in tool logic
    }
}
```

## Step 9: Performance and Scalability

> **📚 Note**: This step demonstrates **performance optimization techniques** for production MCP servers. These are **example patterns** showing how to improve scalability - you don't need to add them to ContosoOrdersMcpServer. Use these concepts when building high-performance MCP servers in the future.

### Caching Strategies

```csharp
private static readonly MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());

[McpServerTool]
public async Task<string> GetProductInventory(string productName)
{
    var cacheKey = $"inventory_{productName}";
    
    if (_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out string cachedResult))
        return cachedResult;
    
    // Fetch fresh data
    var result = await FetchInventoryData(productName);
    
    // Cache for 5 minutes
    _cache.Set(cacheKey, result, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
    
    return result;
}
```

### Async Operations

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
public async Task<string> GetCustomerOrderSummary(string customerId)
{
    // Run multiple operations in parallel
    var orderTask = GetCustomerOrders(customerId);
    var profileTask = GetCustomerProfile(customerId);
    var preferencesTask = GetCustomerPreferences(customerId);
    
    await Task.WhenAll(orderTask, profileTask, preferencesTask);
    
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(new {
        Orders = orderTask.Result,
        Profile = profileTask.Result,
        Preferences = preferencesTask.Result
    });
}
```

## Step 10: Monitoring and Observability

> **📚 Note**: This step presents **monitoring and logging best practices** for production MCP servers. These are **example implementations** to guide your future work - you don't need to add this code to ContosoOrdersMcpServer. Consider these patterns when deploying MCP servers to production environments.

### Tool Usage Logging

```csharp
[McpServerTool]
public async Task<string> GetOrderDetails(string orderId)
{
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    
    try 
    {
        var result = await ProcessOrderLookup(orderId);
        
        // Log successful operation
        _logger.LogInformation("Order lookup completed for {OrderId} in {Duration}ms", 
            orderId, stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
            
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Order lookup failed for {OrderId}", orderId);
        throw;
    }
}
```

## Step 11: Testing Business Logic

> **📚 Note**: This step illustrates **unit testing patterns** for MCP tools. These are **example test cases** showing how to validate business logic - you don't need to add tests to ContosoOrdersMcpServer for this workshop. Use these patterns when building production MCP servers that require comprehensive testing.

### Unit Testing MCP Tools

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task GetOrderDetails_ValidOrder_ReturnsOrderData()
{
    // Arrange
    var tools = new ContosoOrdersTools();
    var orderId = "12345";
    
    // Act
    var result = await tools.GetOrderDetails(orderId);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null);
    var orderData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<dynamic>(result);
    Assert.That(orderData.Customer, Is.EqualTo("John Doe"));
}

[Test] 
public async Task GetOrderDetails_InvalidOrder_ReturnsNotFound()
{
    // Arrange
    var tools = new ContosoOrdersTools();
    var orderId = "99999";
    
    // Act
    var result = await tools.GetOrderDetails(orderId);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.That(result, Does.Contain("not found"));
}
```
